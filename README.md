# WildPrompts x WildHacks2023

Welcome to our Project, WildPrompts! In this ReadME.md, we'll be describing both what this project is and how we did it. 

## What is our project and why should you care?

## Steps for installation and usage

`git clone https://github.com/Amitten77/WildHacks2023.git`

`cd WildHacks2023`

`cd frontend`

`npm install`

As a last step, you need to create a hidden.jsx file that will store all your global variables for using Blockchain and AWS services

`touch hidden.jsx`

In hidden.jsx, fill out the following information, should be included

```
MY_ACCOUNT_ID=<Hedera Testnet Account-ID>
MY_PRIVATE_KEY=<Hedera Testnet Private-Key>
ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS Access Key>
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS Secret Access Key>
```

Now you can run 
`npm run dev`

Enjoy WildPrompts!
